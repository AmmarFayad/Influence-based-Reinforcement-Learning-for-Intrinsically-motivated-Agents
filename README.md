# Influence-based Reinforcement Learning for Intrinsically-motivated Agents
## Overview
This repo provides an implementation of the algorithm 1 (pi-mu framework, see paper for further details) in Pytorch

## Dependencies
* Python 3.4
* PyTorch 0.1.9
* OpenAI Gym
* Numpy 1.14.5
* Multi-Agent Particle Environment

## Code structure

- `make_env.py`: contains code for importing a multiagent environment as an OpenAI Gym-like object.
