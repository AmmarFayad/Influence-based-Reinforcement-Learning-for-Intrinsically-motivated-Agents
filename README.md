# Influence-based Reinforcement Learning for Intrinsically-motivated Agents
## Overview
This repo provides an implementation of the algorithm 1 (pi-mu framework, see paper for further details) in Pytorch

## Dependencies
* Python 3.4
* PyTorch 0.1.9
* OpenAI Gym
* Numpy 1.14.5
* Multi-Agent Particle Environment
## Runs
As mentioned in the paper, we measure the performance of our algorithm on a suite of [PyBullet](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.01290.pdf) continuous control tasks, interfaced through [OpenAI Gym](https://github.com/openai/baselines). We also run experiments on [multi-agent particle envs](https://github.com/openai/multiagent-particle-envs).
